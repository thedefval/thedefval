Network engineer & system architect. I build infrastructure, automate things, and document what I learn.

## What I'm Working On

- Maintaining my homelab infrastructure and keeping the [docs](https://github.com/thedefval/homelab-docs-official) current
- Writing about networking, security, and infrastructure at [dustinlacost.com](https://dustinlacost.com)
- Exploring network security and automation in practical environments

## Focus Areas
```
networking & security
virtualization & containers
infrastructure as code
homelab operations
```

## Projects & Writing

Most of my work here revolves around homelab infrastructure: designing, implementing, and documenting systems that are production-quality at home scale.

**[Gamified Homelab Documentation System](https://github.com/thedefval/homelab-docs-official)** — Comprehensive docs for my documentation strategy  
**[dustinlacost.com](https://dustinlacost.com)** — Technical writeups, guides, and lessons learned

## Philosophy
```
- If you don't have time to do it right the first time, what makes you think you'll have time to do it again?
- There's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution
- Good documentation is the difference between remembering how something works and reverse-engineering your own work
```
